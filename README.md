I'm taking this class as I'm interested in furthering my current knowledge in programming and hopefully pursue a career in IT in networking or some other type of administrative role. I've come from 4 prior years of taking classes in networking, computer repair, and some basics in programming, so I'm looking forward to getting more in touch with the coding aspect of IT. Aside from the prior reasons, I'm also taking this class as it's a prerequisite for many computer science classes in Harper, so I'd like to make the most of the time I'm given to pursue more computer science and programing related classes next year. Overall I'm looking forward to what I'll learn in this class, and thank you for reading this message, hope your having a good morning, afternoon, or evening. I'll see you next Wednesday!
